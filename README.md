# Artificial Inteligence in Videogames: GOAP Simulation

This project contains a simulation developed using the GOAP (a.k.a. _Goal-Oriented Action Planning_) technique in Unity. In this AI technique, multiple agents will make decisions in real-time to satisfy their own goals.

Each individual agent can have a set of goals for different priorities, and a varied range of actions they can perform. A goal can be reached by executing one or more sequences of these actions, and it's the GOAP's behaviour planner which will determine what's the best course of action for each agent based on the current state of the world.

The presented simulation was created for the subject _"Artificial Inteligence in Videogames"_ in the videogame development's degree of the University of La Laguna.

## Simulation

The presented simulation portrays a coliseum, in which warriors will queue

## Agents involved in the simulation

For this simulation, we've defined 4 different types of agents, each one with their own motives and possible actions.

### Warrior

Warriors play a major role in the coliseum, as they'll be the ones to actually engage into fights to entertain the public. Warriors will be split into two different teams, and they'll aim to win as many battles as possible.

- Pre-conditions:
    - Free slot for team in arena.
